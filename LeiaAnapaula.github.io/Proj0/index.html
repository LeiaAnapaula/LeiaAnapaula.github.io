                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Leia, like the princess, and I'm an AI founder in healthcare and spiritual tech. 
                    I grew up in Lima, Peru and I double major in computer science and economics at UC Berkeley.
                    I love flow state, dancing, experimenting with food, and building with inspiring people.</p>
                <h2>Part 1: Selfie</h2>
                    <h3>Close up Selfie</h3>
                    <img src="180-images/selfie-close-up.png" width="300" alt="Close up selfie of Leia">
                    <h3>Zoom Selfie</h3>
                    <img src="180-images/selfie-zoom.png" width="300" alt="Zoom selfie of Leia">

                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>For the close-up selfie, I held the camera very close to my face, which resulted in a more intimate and detailed image. 
                        This selfie has perspective distortion because my features closer to the lens like my forehead and nose appear larger.
                        While the background spreads out.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, the zoom selfie was taken from a greater distance using the camera's zoom function.
                        This selfie has less distortion and a longer focal length. 
                        The background became more compressed, adding context to the image. The lighting was slightly warmer, and my face proportions look more natural.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the two selfies demonstrate how distance and focal length can significantly alter the geometry and feel of a photograph.</p>

                <h2>Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
                    <h3> Zoomed in Campanile</h3>

                    <h3> Close up Campanile</h3>
                    <img src="180-images/Campanile-Closeup.png" height=auto width="300" alt="Close up Campanile">

                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>In the zoomed-in photo of the Campanile, I used the iPhone portrait mode to capture the structure from a distance. 
                    I believe the zoomed-in photo looks flatter because of a longer focal length that caused the perspective compression 
                    smoothed out the subject details, and the background is blurred, which reduces the sense of depth.</p>
                    <p>The close-up photo, on the other hand, was taken from a closer distance with a shorter focal length, which allowed for more detail and texture to be visible.
                    In addition, this photo has a greater sense of depth because the background is more in focus, and the details of the Campanile are sharper.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the two photos demonstrate how perspective compression and depth of field change a photograph with a different distance and focal length.</p>
