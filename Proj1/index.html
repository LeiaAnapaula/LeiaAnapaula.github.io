                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Leia, like the princess, and I'm an AI founder in healthcare and spiritual tech. 
                    I grew up in Lima, Peru and I double major in computer science and economics at UC Berkeley.
                    I love flow state, dancing, experimenting with food, and building with inspiring people.</p>

                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>For the close-up selfie, I held the camera very close to my face, which resulted in a more intimate and detailed image. 
                        This selfie has perspective distortion because my features closer to the lens like my forehead and nose appear larger.
                        While the background spreads out.</p>

                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>In the zoomed-in photo of the Campanile, I used the iPhone portrait mode to capture the structure from a distance. 
                    I believe the zoomed-in photo looks flatter because of a longer focal length that caused the perspective compression 
                    smoothed out the subject details, and the background is blurred, which reduces the sense of depth.</p>
